# Decision Tree Learning

Python implementation of Decision Tree Learning with (and without) Rule Post-Pruning.

Run files [`learning_curve_test.py`](src/learning_curve_test.py) and 
[`cross_validation_test.py`](src/cross_validation_test.py) to see the results. The code was tested with Python 3.7.

Parts of the code are taken from [here](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) and 
[here](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/readme.html);
the specific source, if present, is written at the beginning of each file.
